# Offensive_Language_Detection_Modern_Greek

We report on the development of AIKIA: Corpus for Offensive Language Detection (OLD) in Modern Greek (EL) which is a less-resourced language regarding offensive language detection. AIKIA offers free access to annotated data leveraged from EL Twitter and fiction texts with the lexicon of offensive terms ERIS that draws on HurtLex. AIKIA has been annotated for offensive values with the Best Worst Scaling method that is designed to avoid problems of categorical and scalar annotation methods. BWS  assigns continuous offensive scores in the form of floating point numbers instead of binary integers or binary categorical values. AIKIA's performance for offensive language detection in Modern Greek was tested by fine-tuning a variety of pre-trained language models in a binary classification task. Through experimentation with a number of thresholds, it became evident that the best mapping of the continuous values to binary labels should occur at the range [0.5-0.6] of BWS values and that the pre-trained models on Greek data achieved the highest Macro-F1 scores. Greek-Media-BERT outperformed all models with a threshold of 0.6 by obtaining a Macro-F1 score of 0.92.
